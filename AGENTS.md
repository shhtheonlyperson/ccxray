Guidance for Codex when working with this repository.

## What is ccxray

A transparent HTTP proxy that sits between Codex and the Anthropic API. It records every request/response, serves a real-time Miller-column dashboard at the same port, and supports request interception/editing. Zero config, zero dependencies beyond Node.js.

## Commands

```bash
ccxray                                           # Proxy + dashboard (set ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5577 before running Codex)
ccxray --port 8080                               # Custom port
ccxray status                                    # Show hub info and connected clients
npm run dev                                      # Dev mode (auto-restart on server/public changes)
npm test                                         # Run tests
```

No build step. No linting. Restart to apply changes.

> **Note for Codex**: ccxray proxies the Anthropic API. It does not spawn Codex itself. Start ccxray first, then ensure `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5577` is set in the environment where Codex runs.

## Architecture

### Server (`server/`)

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `server/index.js` | Entry point: HTTP server, request routing, startup |
| `server/config.js` | PORT, ANTHROPIC_HOST/PORT/PROTOCOL, LOGS_DIR, MAX_ENTRIES, model context windows |
| `server/pricing.js` | LiteLLM price fetch, 24h cache, fallback rates, cost calculation |
| `server/cost-budget.js` | Cost data orchestration: cache, warm-up, grouping |
| `server/cost-worker.js` | Child process: scans `~/.claude/projects` and `~/.config/claude/projects` JSONL files without blocking event loop |
| `server/store.js` | In-memory state: entries[] (capped at MAX_ENTRIES), sseClients[], sessions, intercept, versionIndex (keyed by `agentKey::coreHash`). Session detection with subagent inference (inflight + temporal heuristic) |
| `server/sse-broadcast.js` | SSE broadcast to dashboard clients, entry summarization |
| `server/helpers.js` | Tokenization, context breakdown, SSE parsing, formatting |
| `server/system-prompt.js` | KNOWN_AGENTS registry, agent type detection, B2 block splitting, unified diff |
| `server/restore.js` | Startup log restoration, lazy-load req/res from disk, delta chain reconstruction |
| `server/forward.js` | HTTP/HTTPS proxy to Anthropic, SSE capture, response logging, proxyRes error handling |
| `server/routes/api.js` | REST endpoints for entries, tokens, system prompt |
| `server/routes/sse.js` | SSE endpoint |
| `server/routes/intercept.js` | Intercept toggle/approve/reject/timeout |
| `server/routes/costs.js` | Cost budget endpoints |
| `server/hub.js` | Multi-project hub: lockfile (`~/.ccxray/hub.json`), discovery (with orphan port probe fallback), client registration, idle shutdown (injectable via setOnShutdown), crash auto-recovery |
| `server/auth.js` | API key auth middleware (enabled via `AUTH_TOKEN` env) |
| `server/storage/` | Storage adapters (local filesystem, S3/R2). `statShared()` for file mtime. `supportsDelta` flag gates delta-write eligibility |

### Client (`public/`)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `public/index.html` | Dashboard shell |
| `public/style.css` | Dark theme, Miller column layout |
| `public/app.js` | App initialization |
| `public/miller-columns.js` | Projects → Sessions → Turns → Sections → Timeline → Detail |
| `public/entry-rendering.js` | Turn rendering, session/project tracking |
| `public/messages.js` | Merged steps: thinking + tool groups, timeline detail, minimap rendering + layout |
| `public/cost-budget-ui.js` | Cost analysis page, heatmap, burn rate |
| `public/intercept-ui.js` | Pause/edit/approve/reject requests |
| `public/system-prompt-ui.js` | Multi-agent browsing (3-column Miller), version history, unified diffs |
| `public/keyboard-nav.js` | Arrow keys, Enter, Escape |
| `public/quota-ticker.js` | Topbar quota ticker |

### Hub Mode (multi-project)

Hub mode is activated by `ccxray claude` (spawns Claude Code as a child). When using Codex, run `ccxray` directly and share the hub by pointing all Codex instances at the same `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`.

```
ccxray claude (1st)  → fork detached hub → connect as client → spawn claude
ccxray claude (2nd)  → discover hub via ~/.ccxray/hub.json → connect as client → spawn claude
                               ↓
                      Hub (detached process)
                        ├── HTTP proxy on :5577
                        ├── Dashboard (same port)
                        ├── Client registry (register/unregister/health)
                        └── Idle shutdown (5s after last client exits)
```

- Hub lockfile: `~/.ccxray/hub.json` (written after `listen()` succeeds = readiness signal)
- Hub log: `~/.ccxray/hub.log` (stdout/stderr of detached process)
- `--port` opts out of hub mode entirely (independent server)
- Crash recovery: clients monitor hub pid every 5s, auto-fork new hub using port as mutex
- Version check: semver major mismatch → reject, minor → warn, patch → silent

### Data Flow

```
Codex → proxy receives request → detect session (explicit or inferred)
  → [intercept check] → log {id}_req.json → forward to Anthropic
  → capture SSE response → log {id}_res.json → calculate cost
  → broadcast via SSE (includes sessionInferred flag) → dashboard updates
```

Logs stored in `~/.ccxray/logs/` (not package-relative). Respects `CCXRAY_HOME` env var.

### Delta Log Storage

Each `_req.json` normally stores the full `messages` array. For long sessions this wastes 85–90% of disk space (each turn re-stores the entire conversation history). Delta storage writes only new messages and a pointer to the previous turn.

**Format** (delta turn):
```json
{ "model": "...", "max_tokens": 8096, "prevId": "2026-05-01T11-47-17-808", "msgOffset": 18,
  "messages": [ /* only messages[18..] */ ], "sysHash": "...", "toolsHash": "..." }
```

**Format** (full / anchor turn):
```json
{ "model": "...", "max_tokens": 8096, "messages": [ /* all */ ], "sysHash": "...", "toolsHash": "..." }
```

Rules:
- Delta only applies to sessions with an explicit `session_id` (main orchestrator turns). Subagents and inferred sessions always write full format.
- First turn of a session = always full (chain anchor).
- Compaction (messages shrinks) = always full (resets chain).
- `supportsDelta: false` on the storage adapter (e.g. S3) disables delta entirely.
- `CCXRAY_DELTA_SNAPSHOT_N=N` forces a full snapshot every N delta writes (default `0` = only session-start anchor). Use `5` for S3-backed setups.

**Read side**: `loadEntryReqRes` detects `prevId`, recursively loads the chain, and splices `prevMessages[0..msgOffset]` + delta messages. Results are cached in memory (per entry). If `prevId` entry has been pruned, gracefully degrades to showing only the delta portion.
